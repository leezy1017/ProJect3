<h1>Facebook Dilemma</h1>

<p class="ex1" align="justify">

Facebook have been looked with various issues concerning its clients' security control. As indicated by "Facebook Dilemma," part two of the video, Facebook platform has become quick into a worldwide association, pulling in excess of two billion clients. This has made numerous customers who wish to publicize their organizations select this stage since the advert can arrive at an entire tremendous of Facebook clients. The platform has as of late, demonstrated to have various disadvantages . According to Facebook Dilemma, Facebook has been looked with miscommunication whereby it has been seen as a stage for spreading counterfeit news and gossipy tidbits. What's more, it has additionally been related with trading off equity in the United States and infringement of human rights in numerous nations on the planet, just as the discussion being utilized to cause divisions among numerous countries. Because of this unfurling, numerous individuals have lost trust in this platform . Along these lines, the organization need to set up measures to recapture its trust to its clients. This paper looks at the means which Facebook should take to recapture certainty from the clients.
<br>
First, the company should employ enough and more experienced monitoring and security staff to deal with its privacy and the control of information posted on the platform . When one of the former junior manager in the organization was asked why the company management was acting very slowly in addressing the privacy problems, he said, “It is the complexity of dealing with the problems.” He attributes the complexity with the large number of Facebook users across the world. He alleged that it will be difficult to control such a huge population . The company therefore has a responsibility of increasing the number of highly technologically trained staff to monitor and regulate the Facebook activities among the individual users across the world. This lack of enough qualified is further demonstrated from the response of one junior staff during the “Facebook Dilemma” show. He said that he felt horrified when he was given that role of administering privacy control in the company. He adds that he felt “not qualified” for the role. The ex-officer adds that he had written numerous proposals regarding the privacy policy in which the top officials disregarded and he was told to concentrate on the Initial Public Offering. This is therefore, a challenging task to ensure full control of privacy, while at the same time meeting the Initial Public Offering of the company (Hargittai., 2010). Therefore, it is a call for the management to employ more qualified monitoring staff who are sufficient for this difficult task.
The Facebook organization should reconsider its model of operation. According to the “Facebook Dilemma,” It is the greed for monopolism that has made the
 organization go slow in establishing security measures and privacy control.
<br> It is alleged that the organization has left its privacy control on the hands of its users . The organization has been trying to own other online websites such as Whatsapp, Twitter, Instagram, and telegram, in an attempt to gain more followers in order to easily compete with other online advertising companies such Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. Once the organization gets this high number of followers, it tends to distribute the mandate for control of privacy to specific users, whom the company has given mandate to carry out its own advertising tasks. This is as a result of the attention the users are attracting in the platform . As a result, there has been division among the Facebook users as they compete for attention, they therefore end up posting anything regardless of the impact the posted information has on the social fabric. Many of the users cheat the public to attract attention. Since Facebook’s focus is the profits gained from the information posted and the “likes” the information attracts, it assumes no responsibility for any misleading information or bleach of privacy. The company should restructure its strategy of operation and come up with strict measures to control the nature of information posted on the forum, without leaving the privacy control to the individual users .  This is only possible if the company will stop focusing much on the Initial Public Offering it gets from the ad sale business, and focus on the value of information posted on the platform.
Lastly, the Facebook management should shun away from managing its business from only one point. <br>
It is advisable for the company to establish agencies across the countries for maximum control of the public. The Facebook Dilemma presented Facebook organization as having insufficient staff, yet it has a large number of users. This is one of the reasons behind the difficulty in controlling the large population . This strategy will also enable the company to carry out ground tours across the world aimed at educating the public on the proper usage of the forum. 
In conclusion, this paper has addressed the issue of mistrust of Facebook by its users due to its folly privacy policy, 
<br>which has led to challenging of democracy in USA and other countries, violation of human rights and division and hostility across many countries in the world as a result of the spread of propaganda through the forum. Some of the measures the company is supposed to take to cub this situation include: expanding its managing staff across the world though decentralization, employing enough qualified privacy monitoring staff, and restructuring its business operation model .
