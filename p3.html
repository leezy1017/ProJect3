<h1>Shoshana Zuboff on surveillance capitalism</h1>

<p class="ex1" align="justify">

Shoshana Zuboff, in her book 'The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,' argues that tech companies today are after controlling every aspect of data on what people do for profit. Surveillance capitalism involves tech companies doing business with personal data as the primary commodity for sale. The companies acquire personal data through consumer surveillance and monitoring, which is unethical and pose a threat to human dignity and democratic citizenship. Surveillance act as the changing power in the information economy. Surveillance capitalism as an economic pressure is a driver that intensifies online monitoring and connection. Corporate actors, after making profits saturates social life, thus making people wonder if technological advancement is for a greater good. Surveillance capitalism is an area of significant concern in contemporary society since corporate actors seem to be exploiting personal data for business and profits.
Zuboff makes a solid argument on surveillance capitalism in her book,
<br> The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, claiming that it threatens democratic citizenship and human dignity. "…a controlled 'hive' of total connection that seduces with promises of absolute certainty for maximum profit- - at the expense of democracy, freedom, and our human future," Zuboff argues that surveillance capitalism threatens the future of humanity and something must be done to correct the threat. Her book is one of the most read across the globe because of the exciting topic with supportive information to back up the main argument. Different authors have come up with the same case since the rate at which machines are replacing most of the human positions is high. For such reasons, surveillance capitalism is a topic of significant concern as many people perceive it as a threat to human dignity and democratic citizenship. 
As one of the founders of Google, I do not support the idea that the new model developed by the company poses a threat to human dignity and democratic citizenship. The company developed a new model to improve consumer online experience with the utilization of advanced technology. “With little resistance from law or society, surveillance capitalism is on the verge of dominating the social order and shaping the digital future.” Zuboff argues that surveillance capitalism poses a significant threat to the future of humanity without considering the positive side of it. The company is focused on securing personal data of each user and not using it for business. Google has security measures in place to ensure personal data remain confidential and private unless an individual decides to make it public. Claims made by many authors concerning the new model have little truth concerning what the company does and the significant accomplishments it has achieved over the years. Google is not involved in data mining for profit, and therefore, people should not be worried about their personal information being used by the company for business.
Google uses high tech to keep track of what most people do online to ensure they do not pose a threat to themselves and other people.
<br> The company stores the collected data so that when it is needed, the individual can access it. It is helpful especially during an investigation by law enforcers of illegal activity online to arrest the perpetrators. It is the responsibility of the company to ensure the personal information of each person is secure from any threat, including online data miners. Google understands how to improve the services it offers to the people by using the collected data. The company interprets the data to determine sectors that need developing. "…at Google, it was understood that users were unlikely to agree to this unilateral claiming of their experience and its translation into behavioral data." Zuboff argues that the company collects data on the users without their consent, which threatens democratic citizenship and freedom of the people.
The company does not pose a threat to the future of humanity but rather on ensuring an improved technological consumption to enhance future online experience. "…data are then computed and packaged as prediction products and sold into behavioral futures markets." Zuboff claims that the company collects personal data through surveillance to try and understand what people do now, soon, and in the future. By having the behavioral data, the company then predicts the products to sell to the people. Google sells such information to its business customers who are mainly the advertisers. Zuboff states her argument correctly, but the main reason the company tracks cookies is to keep track of the company's traffic. It is an effort to try and improve the services it offers to the users. The company collects data on users to help them have a better experience.
"We rushed to the internet expecting empowerment,  <br>
 the democratization of knowledge, and help with real problems, but surveillance capitalism was just too lucrative to resist." Zuboff claims that people perceived the internet as a solution to most of their problems, but Google failed them by exploiting and collecting personal data for profits. The data collected by the company helps in evaluating the consumer pattern and how they use the internet. It helps the company plan on many of its actions. Before an upgrade, the company uses the data it collects to check on the need of such update and it if will have a positive impact on the users.
"It was Google that first learned how to capture surplus behavioral data, more than what they needed for services…" Zuboff makes a good argument which makes sense, but the main reason for the company to collect the data is different from her case. Google is a fast-developing company, and therefore, it requires up to date information concerning the users to ensure it offers the best services. It is one of the strategies the company uses to remain competitive in the market. Other companies like Facebook understand the importance of the model, and that is why they copied and incorporated in their daily operations. More tech companies use the model to improve their customer experience and gain a competitive advantage in the market.
